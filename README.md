# Project Description

This repository contains my notes and selected exercises from **_An Introduction to Manifolds_** by **Loring W. Tu**.

Originally written in LaTeX, I am currently in the process of rewriting them using **Typst** â€” a modern typesetting system that offers improved readability, faster compilation, and a more streamlined syntax.

The template of note is from https://github.com/tarunjana/noteworthy.
