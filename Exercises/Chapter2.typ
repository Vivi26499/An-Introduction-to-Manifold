  For any two positive real numbers $c, d$, define
  $
    I_A (-c, d) = (-c, 0) union {A} union (0, d)
  $
  
  Similarly for $I_B (-c, d)$, with $B$ in place of $A$. Define a topology on $S$ as follows: on $(RR - {0})$, use the subspace topology inherited from $RR$, with open intervals as a basis. A basis of neighborhoods at $A$ is the collection ${I_A (-c, d) | c, d > 0}$; similarly, a basis of neighborhoods at $B$ is ${I_B (-c, d) | c, d > 0}$.

#sol[
  + To show that $h$ is a homeomorphism, we need to show that it is continuous and has a continuous inverse. \
    + $h$ is injective. \
      Let $x, y in I_A (-c, d)$ such that $h(x) = h(y)$. There are two cases:
      - $h(x) = h(y) = 0$, then $x = y = A$
      - $h(x) = h(y) eq.not 0$, then $h(x) = x$ and $h(y) = y$, so $x = y$.
    + $h$ is surjective. \
      Let $y in (-c, d)$. There are two cases:
      - $y eq.not 0$, then $y in I_A (-c, d)$ and $h(y) = y$.
      - $y = 0$, then $h(A) = 0 = y$.
    + $h$ is continuous. \
      Let $(x, y) subset.eq (-c, d)$ be an open interval. There are two cases:
      - $0 in (x, y)$, then $h^(-1)((x, y)) = I_A (x, y) subset.eq I_A (-c, d)$ is open.
      - $0 in.not (x, y)$, then $h^(-1)((x, y)) = (x, y) subset.eq I_A (-c, d)$ is open.
    + $h^(-1)$ is continuous. \
      There are two cases:
      - $A in (x, y)$, then $h(I_A (x, y)) = (x, y) in (-c, d)$ is open.
      - $A in.not (x, y)$, then $h((x, y)) = (x, y) in (-c, d)$ is open.
    Therefore, $h$ is a homeomorphism.
  + + $S$ is locally Euclidean. \
    From (a), we know that for any $x in S$, there is a neighborhood $U$ of $x$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to an open subset of $RR$ with $h$ as the homeomorphism. 
    + $S$ is second countable. \
    + $S$ is not Hausdorff. 
      Consider the points $A$ and $B$. For any open set $U$ containing $A$, we have $U = I_A (-a_1, a_2)$ for some $a_1, a_2 > 0$. Similarly, for any open set $V$ containing $B$, we have $V = I_B (-b_1, b_2)$ for some $b_1, b_2 > 0$. Suppose $U inter V = nothing$. Let $c_1 = max(a_1, b_1)$ and $c_2 = min(a_2, b_2)$. Then $U inter V = (c_1, 0) union (0, c_2)$, which is not empty. Therefore, $S$ is not Hausdorff.

  A fundamental theorem of topology, the theorem on invariance of dimension, states that if two nonempty open sets $U subset.eq RR^n$ and $V subset.eq RR^m$ are homeomorphic, then $n = m$. Use the idea of Example 5.4 as well as the theorem on invariance of dimension to
  prove that the sphere with a hair in $RR^3$ is not locally Euclidean at $q$. Hence it
  cannot be a topological manifold.

  Suppose the sphere with a hair is locally Euclidean of dimension $n$ at $q$. Then there is a neighborhood $U$ of $q$ such that $U$ is homeomorphic to an open ball $B = B(0, epsilon) subset.eq RR^n$ with $q$ mapping to $0$. The homeomorphism $U arrow B$ restricts to a homeomorphism $U without {q} arrow B without {0}$. Since $B without {0}$ is either connected if $n gt.eq 2$ or has two connected components if $n = 1$ and $U without {q}$ has two connected components, $n$ must be $1$, i.e., $U$ is homeomorphic to an open interval $U subset.eq RR$. However, a neighborhood on the sphere has dimension $2$. By invarience of dimension, the sphere with a hair cannot be locally Euclidean at $q$.

  The Grassmannian $G(k,n)$ is the set of all $k$-planes through the origin in $RR^n$. Such a $k$-plane is a linear subspace of dimension $k$ of $RR^n$ and has a basis consisting of $k$ linearly independent vectors $a_1,...,a_k$ in $RR^n$. It is therefore completely specified by an $n times k$ matrix $A = [a_1 ... a_k]$ of rank $k$, where the rank of a matrix $A$, denoted by $"rk"A$, is defined to be the number of linearly independent columns of $A$. This matrix is called a matrix representative of the $k$-plane.
  
  Two bases $a_1,...,a_k$ and $b_1,...,b_k$ determine the same $k$-plane if there is a change-of-basis matrix $g = [g_(i j)] in "GL"(k, RR)$ such that
  
  $
    b_j = sum_i a_i g_(i j), quad 1 <= i,j <= k.
  $
  
  In matrix notation, $B = A g$.
  
  Let $F(k,n)$ be the set of all $n times k$ matrices of rank $k$, topologized as a subspace of $RR^(n times k)$, and $tilde$ the equivalence relation
  
  $
    A tilde B quad "iff" quad text("there is a matrix") g in "GL"(k, RR) text(" such that") B = A g.
  $
  
  In the notation of Problem B.3, $F(k,n)$ is the set $D_"max"$ in $RR^(n times k)$ and is therefore an open subset. There is a bijection between $G(k,n)$ and the quotient space $F(k,n)/tilde$. We give the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$ the quotient topology on $F(k,n)/tilde$.
  
  + Show that $tilde$ is an open equivalence relation. (Hint: Either mimic the proof of Proposition 7.14 or apply Problem 7.5.)
  
  + Prove that the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$ is second countable. (Hint: Apply Corollary 7.10.)
  
  + Let $S = F(k,n)$. Prove that the graph $R$ in $S times S$ of the equivalence relation $tilde$ is closed. (Hint: Two matrices $A = [a_1 ... a_k]$ and $B = [b_1 ... b_k]$ in $F(k,n)$ are equivalent if and only if every column of $B$ is a linear combination of the columns of $A$ if and only if $"rk"[A B] <= k$ if and only if all $(k + 1) times (k + 1)$ minors of $[A B]$ are zero.)
  
  + Prove that the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$ is Hausdorff. (Hint: Mimic the proof of Proposition 7.16.)
  
  Next we want to find a $C^infinity$ atlas on the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$. For simplicity, we specialize to $G(2,4)$. For any $4 times 2$ matrix $A$, let $A_(i j)$ be the $2 times 2$ submatrix consisting of its $i$th row and $j$th row. Define
  
  $
    V_(i j) = {A in F(2,4) | A_(i j) text(" is nonsingular")}.
  $
  
  Because the complement of $V_(i j)$ in $F(2,4)$ is defined by the vanishing of $det A_(i j)$, we conclude that $V_(i j)$ is an open subset of $F(2,4)$.
  #set enum(start: 5)
  + Prove that if $A in V_(i j)$, then $A g in V_(i j)$ for any nonsingular matrix $g in "GL"(2, RR)$.
  
  + Define $U_(i j) = V_(i j) / tilde$. Since $tilde$ is an open equivalence relation, $U_(i j) = V_(i j) / tilde$ is an open subset of $G(2,4)$.
  
  For $A in V_(12)$,
  
  $
    A tilde A A_(12)^(-1) = mat(
      1, 0;
      0, 1;
      *, *;
      *, *
    ) = mat(
      I;
      A_(34)A_(12)^(-1)
    ).
  $
  
  This shows that the matrix representatives of a 2-plane in $U_(12)$ have a canonical form $B$ in which $B_(12)$ is the identity matrix.
  
  + Show that the map $tilde(phi)_(12): V_(12) -> RR^(2 times 2)$,
  
  $
    tilde(phi)_(12)(A) = A_(34)A_(12)^(-1),
  $
  
  induces a homeomorphism $phi_(12): U_(12) -> RR^(2 times 2)$.
  
  + Define similarly homeomorphisms $phi_(i j): U_(i j) -> RR^(2 times 2)$. Compute $phi_(12) compose phi_(23)^(-1)$, and show that it is $C^infinity$.
  
  + Show that ${U_(i j) | 1 <= i < j <= 4}$ is an open cover of $G(2,4)$ and that $G(2,4)$ is a smooth manifold.
  
  Similar consideration shows that $F(k,n)$ has an open cover ${V_I}$, where $I$ is a strictly ascending multi-index $1 <= i_1 < ... < i_k <= n$. For $A in F(k,n)$, let $A_I$ be the $k times k$ submatrix of $A$ consisting of $i_1$th, ..., $i_k$th rows of $A$. Define
  
  $
    V_I = {A in G(k,n) | det A_I != 0}.
  $
  
  Next define $tilde(phi)_I: V_I -> RR^((n-k) times k)$ by
  
  $
    tilde(phi)_I(A) = (A A_I^(-1))_(I'),
  $
  
  where $()_(I')$ denotes the $(n - k) times k$ submatrix obtained from the complement $I'$ of the multi-index $I$. Let $U_I = V_I / tilde$. Then $tilde(phi)$ induces a homeomorphism $phi: U_I -> RR^((n-k) times k)$. It is not difficult to show that ${(U_I, phi_I)}$ is a $C^infinity$ atlas for $G(k,n)$. Therefore the Grassmannian $G(k,n)$ is a $C^infinity$ manifold of dimension $k(n - k)$.
